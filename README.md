# Trippin

Trippin is a map-first journey planner that lets users create and share real travel routes with photos pinned along the journey — not just destinations.

## Problem
Travel planning tools focus on destinations and reviews, but fail to show how people actually travel a place — the route, order of stops, time spent, and scenic segments.

## Solution
Trippin allows users to create journeys by plotting routes and attaching geo-tagged photos and notes along the way. Other users can view or clone these journeys to plan their own trips.

## Core Feature
Photos pinned along a route to reflect the journey, not just destinations.
